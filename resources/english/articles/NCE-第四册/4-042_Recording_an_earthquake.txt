While the drum was being shaken, the line that the pen was drawing wriggled from side to side. ->> 当圆筒受到震动时，笔所画出的线就会左右摆动。
The apparatus thus described, however, records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, which is, in fact, much more complicated. ->> 然而，这种装置只能记录地震波运动的水平部分，实际上运动要复杂得多。
If we could actually see the path described by a particle, such as a sand grain in the rock, it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing round the room; it would be up and down, to and fro and from side to side. ->> 假如我们能看到例如岩石中的沙粒的运动轨迹，那会更像一只嗡嗡叫的绿头苍蝇在屋内飞行的轨迹，呈现出上上下下、来来回回、左左右右的运动。
Instruments have been devised and can be so placed that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs. ->> 已经设计出了一些仪器，按照一定的安放方式可测绘出这三种运动的图。
When the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre, the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after the other at short intervals. ->> 如果把这种仪器安装在距震源700多英里远的地方，曲线记录就能显示出三种波前后相继到达。
The first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations. ->> 首先记录下的是纵向波的到达。
The second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first. ->> 然后记录下的是横向波的到达，横向波传播得更慢，在纵向波到达几分钟后到达。
These two have traveled through the earth. ->> 这两种波都是穿过地球而来的。
It was from the study of these that so much was learnt about the interior of the earth. ->> 正是从对这两种波的研究中，人们了解到地球内部的许多情况。
