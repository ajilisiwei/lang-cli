Two main techniques have been used for training elephants, which we may respectively call the tough and the gentle. ->> 驯象有两种主要的方法，我们分别称之为强硬法和温柔法。
The former method simply consists of setting an elephant to work and beating him until he does what is expected of him. ->> 强硬法就是驱象去干活，直到把它打得顺从。
Apart from moral considerations this is a stupid method of training, for it produces a resentful animal who at a later stage may well turn man-killer. ->> 且不说道义问题，这本身就是一种愚蠢的训练方法，因为这种方法会使动物反感，在以后某个时期可能会变成伤人的动物。
The gentle method requires more patience in the early stages, but produces a cheerful, good-tempered elephant who will give many years of loyal service. ->> 温柔法要求在最初阶段保持较大的耐心，但这种方法可以训练出性情愉快、脾气温顺，能忠实为人服务多年的大象。
The first essential in elephant training is to assign to the animal a single mahout who will be entirely responsible for the job. ->> 驯象中至关重要的是指派一名专门的驯象员，全面负责这项工作。
Elephants like to have one master just as dogs do, and are capable of a considerable degree of personal affection. ->> 大象和狗一样，喜欢有一个专一的主人，而且会对主人产生相当深厚的感情。
There are even stories of half-trained elephant calves who have refused to feed and pined to death when by some unavoidable circumstance they have been deprived of their own trainer. ->> 甚至有这样的故事：半驯的小象由于不可避免的情况与自己的训练员分离后，竟拒绝吃食，消瘦至死。
Such extreme cases must probably be taken with a grain of salt, but they do underline the general principle that the relationship between elephant and mahout is the key to successful training. ->> 这种极端的例子虽不可尽信，但强调了一个基本原则，象和驯象员之间的关系是驯象成功与否的关键。
The most economical age to capture an elephant for training is between fifteen and twenty years, for it is then almost ready to undertake heavy work and can begin to earn its keep straight away. ->> 最经济的驯象年龄是15至20岁，此时的大象几乎已准备好承担重活，并能立即开始负担其饲养费用。
But animals of this age do not easily become subservient to man, and a very firm hand must be employed in the early stages. ->> 然而，这个年龄的象不易驯服，因此早期阶段必须有很强的管控能力。
The captive elephant, still roped to a tree, plunges and screams every time a man approaches, and for several days will probably refuse all food through anger and fear. ->> 捕获后绑在树上的象每当有人走近时，会扑腾尖叫，而且可能因愤怒和恐惧几天不进食。
Sometimes a tame elephant is tethered nearby to give the wild one confidence, and in most cases the captive gradually quietens down and begins to accept its food. ->> 有时，拴在附近的一头驯象可以给野象以信心，在大多数情况下，捕获的象会渐渐安静下来并开始进食。
The next stage is to get the elephant to the training establishment, a ticklish business which is achieved with the aid of two tame elephants roped to the captive on either side. ->> 下一步是把象带到训练场，这是一项棘手的工作，需要在象两侧各系上一头驯服的大象才能完成。
When several elephants are being trained at one time, it is customary for the new arrival to be placed between the stalls of two captives whose training is already well advanced. ->> 几头象同时训练时，通常新来的会被安置在两头训练得很好的象之间的围栏中。
It is then left completely undisturbed with plenty of food and water so that it can absorb the atmosphere of its new home and see that nothing particularly alarming is happening to its companions. ->> 然后给它充分的食物和水，且不打扰它，以便它能适应新居的环境，并看到同伴们没有发生任何可怕的事情。
When it is eating normally, its own training begins. ->> 当它进食正常后，训练就开始。
The trainer stands in front of the elephant holding a long stick with a sharp metal point. ->> 驯练员手持一根有锋利金属尖头的长棒，站在象前。
Two assistants, mounted on tame elephants, control the captive from either side, while others rub their hands over his skin to the accompaniment of a monotonous and soothing chant. ->> 两个助手骑在驯服的象背上，从两侧控制被驯象，其他人唱着单调的歌声用手抚摸象的皮肤。
This is supposed to induce pleasurable sensations in the elephant, and its effects are reinforced by the use of endearing epithets. ->> 据说这会让象产生愉快的感觉，为了加强这种效果，人们还会使用亲切的称呼。
The elephant is then called 'son', or 'ho! my father', or 'my mother', according to the age and sex of the captive. ->> 然后根据象的年龄和性别，人们称它为“儿子”、“哎！我的爸爸”或“我的妈妈”。
The elephant is not immediately susceptible to such blandishments, however, and usually lashes fiercely with its trunk in all directions. ->> 然而，大象不会立刻被这些讨好的话打动，通常会用鼻子朝四面八方猛烈地甩动。
These movements are controlled by the trainer with the metal-pointed stick, and the trunk eventually becomes so sore that the elephant curls it up and seldom afterwards uses it for offensive purposes. ->> 训练员用有锋利金属尖的长棒控制象的这些动作，象鼻子最后疼得卷了起来，之后就很少用鼻子去进攻了。
