In his own lifetime Galileo was the centre of violent controversy; but the scientific dust has long since settled, and today we can see even his famous clash with the Inquisition in something like its proper perspective. ->> 伽利略在世时是激烈论战的中心，但科学上的尘埃早已落定，今天我们甚至可以如实地看待他与宗教法庭的著名冲突。  
But, in contrast, it is only in modern times that Galileo has become a problem child for historians of science. ->> 然而，相比之下，伽利略成为科学史家的新难题仅是在现代。  
The old view of Galileo was delightfully uncomplicated. ->> 过去对伽利略的看法是令人满意的简单明了。  
He was, above all, a man who experimented: who despised the prejudices and book learning of the Aristotelians, who put his questions to nature instead of to the ancients, and who drew his conclusions fearlessly. ->> 他首先是个实验工作者，蔑视亚里士多德学派的偏见和书本知识，向自然界而不是向古人提出问题，并大胆地得出结论。  
He had been the first to turn a telescope to the sky, and he had seen there evidence enough to overthrow Aristotle and Ptolemy together. ->> 他是第一个把望远镜对准天空的人，看到的证据足以推翻亚里士多德和托勒密。  
He was the man who climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropped various weights from the top, who rolled balls down inclined planes, and then generalized the results of his many experiments into the famous law of free fall. ->> 他就是那个爬上比萨斜塔并从塔顶抛掷不同重物、让小球沿斜面滚动的人，并将多次实验结果概括成著名的自由落体定律的人。  
But a closer study of the evidence, supported by a deeper sense of the period, and particularly by a new consciousness of the philosophical undercurrents in the scientific revolution, has profoundly modified this view of Galileo. ->> 但是，通过对证据更深入的研究，结合对那个时代的更深刻理解，尤其是对科学革命中哲学潜流的新的意识，极大地改变了对伽利略的看法。  
Today, although the old Galileo lives on in many popular writings, among historians of science a new and more sophisticated picture has emerged. ->> 今天，尽管在许多通俗读物中旧的伽利略形象依然存在，但在科学史家中，一个新的更复杂的伽利略形象已经出现。  
At the same time our sympathy for Galileo's opponents has grown somewhat. ->> 与此同时，我们对伽利略反对者的同情也有所增加。  
His telescopic observations are justly immortal; they aroused great interest at the time, they had important theoretical consequences, and they provided a striking demonstration of the potentialities hidden in instruments and apparatus. ->> 伽利略用望远镜的观察确实是不朽的，这些观察当时引起了极大的兴趣，具有重要的理论意义，并充分显示出仪器设备中隐藏的潜力。  
But can we blame those who looked and failed to see what Galileo saw, if we remember that to use a telescope at the limit of its powers calls for long experience and intimate familiarity with one's instrument? ->> 但如果我们想到使用一架望远镜达到极限需要长期的经验和对仪器的熟悉，我们还能责备那些尽管观察了天空却没看到伽利略所看到的东西的人吗？  
Was the philosopher who refused to look through Galileo's telescope more culpable than those who alleged that the spiral nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's great telescope in the eighteen-forties were scratches left by the grinder? ->> 那位拒绝通过伽利略望远镜观察的哲学家，难道比那些声称19世纪40年代用罗斯勋爵的大望远镜观察到的螺旋星云是打磨工留下的刮痕的人更应受到责备吗？  
We can perhaps forgive those who said the moons of Jupiter were produced by Galileo's spyglass if we recall that in his day, as for centuries before, curved glass was the popular contrivance for producing not truth but illusion, untruth; and if a single curved glass would distort nature, how much more would a pair of them? ->> 或许我们可以原谅那些说木星的卫星是伽利略的望远镜制造出来的人，如果我们想到在他那个时代，乃至几个世纪以来，弯曲的玻璃只是用来制造幻象和虚假的东西，那么如果一块玻璃可以扭曲自然，两块玻璃的效果会如何呢？
