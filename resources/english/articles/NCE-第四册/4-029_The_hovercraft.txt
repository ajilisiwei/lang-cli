Many strange new means of transport have been developed in our century, the strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft. ->> 本世纪已研制出许多新奇的交通工具，其中最新奇的要数气垫船了。

In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell, who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads, suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles. ->> 1953年，有一位50多岁名叫克里斯托弗·科克雷尔的前电子工程师，改行在诺福克郡的湖泊地区从事造船业，他向英国政府和工业界提出了他研究多年的一个想法。

It was the idea of supporting a craft on a 'pad', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air. ->> 他的设想是用一个低压空气或软垫来支撑船体，软垫周围用高压空气环绕。

Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, or land vehicles -- for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft. ->> 自那以后，人们很难决定是否应该将这种运载工具列为轮船、飞机，或是陆上交通工具，因为它是介于船和飞机之间。

As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed. ->> 作为一个船舶技师，科克雷尔在寻找解决波浪阻力的问题，因为波浪阻力浪费掉了船在水面行驶的大量动力，从而限制了船的速度。

His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft. ->> 他的解决办法是用大量环状喷气嘴把船体提离水面。

It 'flies', therefore, but it cannot fly higher -- its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides. ->> 它因此可以“飞行”，但飞不高——它的飞行取决于它所悬浮的水面或地面。

The first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation. ->> 1959年，在苏伦特海峡进行的首次试航引起了轰动。

The hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, and sat down on a road. ->> 气垫船先是在水面上行驶，后又登上海岸，爬上沙丘，最后停在路上。

Later it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem. ->> 后来它横渡英吉利海峡，平稳地在波浪上方行驶，波浪不再产生阻力。

Since that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service. ->> 从那以后，各种各样的气垫船出现了，并开始定期航行服务。

The hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia; it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl', carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports; giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic; and the railway of the future may well be the 'hovertrain', riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds up to 300 m.p.h. -- the possibilities appear unlimited. ->> 气垫船在非洲、澳大利亚等交通不发达地区特别有用。它能成为“飞行水果盘”，把香蕉从种植园运到港口。大型的气垫班轮或许能跨越大西洋。未来的火车或许能成为“气垫火车”，靠气垫在单轨上行驶而不接触轨道，时速可达每小时300英里。可能性似乎是无限的。

I bought a new cushion for the living room sofa yesterday. ->> 我昨天给客厅的沙发买了一个新座垫。  
She always sits on a cushion during meditation. ->> 她冥想时总是坐在一个座垫上。  

The trees ring the small clearing, creating a peaceful atmosphere. ->> 树木围绕着小空地，营造出宁静的氛围。  
As the crowd began to ring the stage, excitement filled the air. ->> 当人群开始围住舞台时，空气中充满了兴奋。
