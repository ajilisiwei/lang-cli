How it came about that snakes manufactured poison is a mystery. ->> 蛇是怎样产生毒液的，这是一个谜。
Over the periods their saliva, a mild, digestive juice like our own, was converted into a poison that defies analysis even today. ->> 蛇的唾液本来和我们人的消化液一样柔和，但经过漫长的时间，演变成了今天仍无法分析清楚的毒液。
It was not forced upon them by the survival competition; they could have caught and lived on prey without using poison, just as the thousands of non-poisonous snakes still do. ->> 毒液不是生存竞争强加给它们的，它们也可以不用毒液捕捉猎物而生存，就像今天成千上万的无毒蛇那样。
Poison to a snake is merely a luxury; it enables it to get its food with very little effort, no more effort than one bite. ->> 毒液对蛇来说只不过是一种奢侈品；它使蛇只需轻咬一口就能毫不费力地捕获食物。
And why only snakes? ->> 为什么只有蛇才有毒液呢？
Cats, for instance, would be greatly helped; no running fights with large, fierce rats or tussles with grown rabbits -- just a bite and no more effort needed. ->> 譬如说，如果猫有毒液，那对猫会大有帮助，它就不必再和又大又凶的老鼠边跑边搏斗了，也不必再和成熟的兔子扭斗了，只要咬一口，就不必再费力了。
In fact, it would be an assistance to all carnivores though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other. ->> 事实上，任何食肉动物有了毒液，都能从中获益，不过当它们互相争斗时，毒液就成了一把双刃剑。
But, of the vertebrates, unpredictable Nature selected only snakes (and one lizard). ->> 然而，在脊椎动物中，大自然仅选择了蛇（还有一种蜥蜴）。
One wonders saliva into why Nature, with respect from that of others, as other on the blood. ->> 人们弄不清楚大自然为什么在某些蛇的身上调制出与其他动物不同的，如此高效的毒液来。
In the conversion of saliva into poison, one might suppose that a fixed process took place. ->> 人们可能认为，唾液转变成毒液有一个固定的程序。
It did not; some snakes manufacture a poison different in every respect from that of others, as different as arsenic is from strychnine, and having different effects. ->> 实际上并没有；有些蛇产生的毒液在各方面都与另外一些蛇的毒液不同，就像砒霜不同于马钱子碱一样，且效果各异。
One poison acts on the nerves, the other on the blood. ->> 一种毒液作用于神经，另一种毒液作用于血液。
The makers of the nerve poison include the mambas and the cobras and their venom is called neurotoxic. ->> 产生神经毒液的蛇包括树眼镜蛇和眼镜蛇，它们的毒液称为神经毒素。
Vipers (adders) and rattlesnakes manufacture the blood poison, which is known as haemolytic. ->> 蝰蛇（蝮蛇）和响尾蛇产生血液毒素，称为溶血性毒液。
Both poisons are unpleasant, but by far the more unpleasant is the blood poison. ->> 这两种毒液都很可怕，但溶血性毒液尤其厉害。
It is said that the nerve poison is the more primitive of the two, that the blood poison is, so to speak, a newer product from an improved formula. ->> 据说，神经毒液在两种毒液中是较为原始的一种，而溶血性毒液，打个比方说，是根据改良配方生产的一种较新的产品。
Be that as it may, the nerve poison does its business with man far more quickly than the blood poison. ->> 不论怎样，神经毒液在人身上起作用比溶血性毒液快得多。
This, however, means nothing. ->> 但这其实没有什么意义。
Snakes did not acquire their poison for use against man but for use against prey such as rats and mice, and the effects on these of viperine poison is almost immediate. ->> 因为蛇产生毒液不是为了对付人类，而是为了捕捉鼠类等猎物，毒液对这些猎物的作用几乎是立竿见影的。
