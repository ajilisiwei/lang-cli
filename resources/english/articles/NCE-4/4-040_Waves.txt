Waves are the children of the struggle between ocean and atmosphere, the ongoing signatures of infinity. ->> 海浪是海洋和大气相斗的产物，是无限的一种不间断的标志。
Rays from the sun excite and energize the atmosphere of the earth, awakening it to flow, to movement, to rhythm, to life. ->> 太阳光激发并赋予地球大气能量，使其流动、运动、形成节奏并焕发生命。
The wind then speaks the message of the sun to the sea and the sea transmits it on through waves -- an ancient, exquisite, powerful message. ->> 然后，风将太阳的信息带给大海，海洋通过波浪传递这个信息 -- 一个古老、精致而又强有力的信息。
These ocean waves are among the earth's most complicated natural phenomena. ->> 这些海浪是地球上最复杂的自然现象之一。
The basic features include a crest (the highest point of the wave), a trough (the lowest point), a height (the vertical distance from the trough to the crest), a wave length (the horizontal distance between two wave crests), and a period (which is the time it takes a wave crest to travel one wave length). ->> 它们的基本特征包括浪峰（波浪的最高点）、波谷（最低点）、浪高（从波谷到浪峰的垂直距离）、波长（两个浪峰间的水平距离）和周期（一个浪峰走过一个波长所需的时间）。
Although an ocean wave gives the impression of a wall of water moving in your direction, in actuality waves move through the water leaving the water about where it was. ->> 虽然海浪给人的印象是一堵水墙向你压来，但实际上，浪是穿过水的，水大致留在原地。
If the water was moving with the wave, the ocean and everything on it would be racing in to the shore with obviously catastrophic results. ->> 如果水和浪一起移动，那么大海与其上的一切就会向岸边疾涌，带来显然的灾难性后果。
An ocean wave passing through deep water causes a particle on the surface to move in a roughly circular orbit, drawing the particle first towards the advancing wave, then up into the wave, then forward with it and then -- as the wave leaves the particles behind -- back to its starting point again. ->> 海浪穿过深水时，使水面上的一个颗粒沿着一个近乎圆形的轨道移动，先将颗粒拉向推进的海浪，再推上波浪，随着波浪前进，然后 -- 当波浪将颗粒抛在后面时 -- 又回到起点。
From both maturity to death, a wave is subject to the same laws as any other 'living' thing. ->> 从成熟到消亡，波浪和其他任何“生命体”一样，都服从相同的法则。
For a time it assumes a miraculous individuality that, in the end, is reabsorbed into the great ocean of life. ->> 有一段时间，它获得了神奇的个性，但最终又被重新融入生命的浩瀚海洋。
The undulating waves of the open sea are generated by three natural causes: wind, earth movements or tremors, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. ->> 公海上起伏的波浪由三种自然原因产生：风、地球移动或震颤以及月亮和太阳的引力。
Once waves have been generated, gravity is the force that drives them in a continual attempt to restore the ocean surface to a flat plain. ->> 一旦波浪形成，重力就是驱动它们的力量，不断尝试将海面恢复为平面。
