The deepest holes of all made for oil, and they go down to as much as 25,000 feet. ->> 在所有钻孔中，为寻找石油而钻的孔是最深的，这些孔可深达25,000英尺。
But we do not need to send men down to get the oil out, as we must with other mineral deposits. ->> 但是，我们不必像开采其他矿藏那样，把人送到地下去把石油取出。
The holes are only borings, less than a foot in diameter. ->> 这些孔只不过是一些钻孔，直径不到1英尺。
My particular experience is largely in oil, and the search for oil has done more to improve deep drilling than any other mining activity. ->> 我的经验主要在石油领域，寻找石油对改进深钻技术的贡献比任何其他采矿活动都大。
When it has been decided where we are going to drill, we put up at the surface an oil derrick. ->> 当确定钻井位置后，我们就在地面竖起一个井架。
It has to be tall because it is like a giant block and tackle, and we have to lower into the ground and haul out of the ground great lengths of drill pipe which are rotated by an engine at the top and are fitted with a cutting bit at the bottom. ->> 井架必须很高，因为它像一个巨型滑轮组，我们必须将很长的钻杆钻入地下，然后再从地下拉出。钻杆顶部安装的发动机带动钻杆旋转，底部则装有钻头。
The geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached, so every so often a sample is obtained with a coring bit. ->> 地质学家需要知道钻头已经到达了什么样的岩层，因此时常要用芯钻头取样。
It cuts a clean cylinder of rock, from which can be seen the strata the drill has been cutting through. ->> 这种钻头能切割出光滑的圆柱形岩石，从中可以看出所钻透的地层。
Once we get down to the oil, it usually flows to the surface because great pressure, either from gas or water, is pushing it. ->> 一旦到达石油层，石油通常会由于天然气或水产生的巨大压力流到地面。
This pressure must be under control, and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe. ->> 这种压力必须加以控制，我们通过让泥浆在钻杆中循环的方法来控制压力。
We endeavour to avoid the old, romantic idea of a gusher, which wastes oil and gas. ->> 我们努力避免采用陈旧而富浪漫色彩的喷井方式，因为那样会浪费石油和天然气。
We want it to stay down the hole until we can lead it off in a controlled manner. ->> 我们希望石油能够留在井内，直到我们可以以受控的方式将其引出。
