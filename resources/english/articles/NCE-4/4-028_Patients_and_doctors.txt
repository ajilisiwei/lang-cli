This is a sceptical age, but although our faith in many of the things in which our forefathers fervently believed has weakened, our confidence in the curative properties of the bottle of medicine remains the same a theirs. ->> 这是一个怀疑的时代，但是尽管我们对祖先所笃信的许多事物的信仰已经减弱，我们对药瓶疗效的信心仍然和他们一样坚定。  
This modern faith in medicines is proved the fact that the annual drug bill of the Health Services is mounting to astronomical figures and shows no signs at present of ceasing to rise. ->> 现代人对药物的这种信任可以从卫生部门药品的年度费用已经上升到天文数字且目前显示无停止上升的迹象这一事实中得到证明。  
The majority of the patients attending the medical out-patients departments of our hospitals feel that they have not received adequate treatment unless they are able to carry home with them some tangible remedy in the shape of a bottle of medicine, a box of pills, or a small jar of ointment, and the doctor in charge of the department is only too ready to provide them with these requirements. ->> 上医院门诊部就诊的大多数病人觉得，如果不能带回一些实体药物，如一瓶药水、一盒药丸或一小罐药膏，就算不上得到了充分治疗，而负责门诊的医生往往也乐于为患者提供这些要求。  
There is no quicker method of disposing of patients then by giving them what they are asking for, and since most medical men in the Health Services are overworked and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits etc., the bottle, the box, and the jar are almost always granted them. ->> 给病人他们所要求的东西是处理病人最快的方法，由于卫生部门的大多数医生都超负荷工作，他们很少有时间提出有关饮食、健康生活及戒除不良习惯等既费时又不受欢迎的建议，因此几乎总是给他们开瓶装药、盒装药和罐装药。  
Nor is it only the ignorant and ill-educated person who has such faith in the bottle of medicine. ->> 这不仅仅是那些无知和缺乏教育的人才对药瓶子有如此的信任。   
It is recounted of Thomas Carlyle that when him in his pocket what remained of a bottle of medicine formerly prescribed for an indisposition of Mrs. ->> 据说托马斯·卡莱尔曾有过这样一件事：他听说朋友亨利·泰勒病了，就立刻跑去看他，衣袋里装着妻子身体不适时剩下的一瓶药。  
Carlyle's. ->> 卡莱尔对药瓶里装的是什么一无所知，对朋友得的是什么病一无所知，对妻子以前得的是什么病也一无所知，但他认为，一种药既然对某种病有效，肯定对另一种病也会有效。  
Carlyle was entirely ignorant of what the bottle in his pocket contained, of the nature of the illness from which his friend was suffering, and of what had previously been wrong with his wife, but a medicine that had worked so well in one form of illness would surely be of equal benefit in another, and comforted by the thought of the help he was bringing to his friend, he hastened to Henry Taylor's house. ->> 想到自己能帮助朋友，他感到很欣慰，于是匆匆赶到了亨利·泰勒的家。  
History does not relate whether his friend accepted his medical help, but in all probability he did. ->> 历史没有记载他的朋友是否接受了他的药物帮助，但很可能接受了。  
The great advantage of taking medicine is that it makes no demands on the taker beyond that of putting up for a moment with a disgusting taste, and that is what all patients demand of their doctors -- to be cured at no inconvenience to themselves. ->> 服药的最大优点是：除了暂时忍受一下让人作呕的味道外，对服药者没有别的要求，这也正是病人对医生的要求——病要治好，但不要太麻烦。
