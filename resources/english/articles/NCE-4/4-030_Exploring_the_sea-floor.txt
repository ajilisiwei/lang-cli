Our knowledge of the oceans a hundred years ago was confined to the two-dimensional shape of the sea surface and the hazards of navigation presented by the irregularities in depth of the shallow water close to the land. ->> 100年前，我们对海洋的了解仅限于二维的海面形状，以及靠近陆地的浅水区深度不规则对航行带来的危险。

The open sea was deep and mysterious, and anyone who gave more than a passing thought to the bottom confines of the oceans probably assumed that the sea bed was flat. ->> 无边无际的海洋深邃而神秘，凡是稍微想过海底的人大概都会认为海底是平坦的。

Sir James Clark Ross had obtained a sounding of over 2,400 fathoms in 1839, but it was not until 1869 that a series of deep soundings was obtained in the Atlantic and the first samples were collected by dredging the bottom. ->> 1839年，詹姆斯·克拉克·罗斯爵士测得了超过2,400英寻的深度，但直到1869年，通过皇家学会用“豪猪号”的几次巡航才在大西洋进行了一系列深度测量，并通过挖掘海底获得了首批样品。

Shortly after this, the famous H.M.S. Challenger expedition established the study of the sea-floor as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists. ->> 此后不久，英国著名的“挑战者号”考察确立了海床研究作为一个值得顶尖物理学家和地质学家研究的课题。

A burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables soon confirmed the Challenger's observation that many parts of the ocean were two to three miles deep, and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude. ->> 随着铺设海底电缆活动的增加，很快证实了“挑战者号”的观察，海洋中很多地方有两到三英里深，并存在许多大规模的水下特征。

Today, enough soundings are available to enable a relief map of the Atlantic to be drawn and we know something of the great variety of the sea bed's topography. ->> 如今，有了足够的数据可以绘制大西洋的地形图，我们也对海床地形的多样性有所了解。

Since the sea covers the greater part of the earth's surface, it is quite reasonable to regard the sea floor as the basic form of the crust of the earth, with, superimposed upon, it the continents, together with the islands and other features of the oceans. ->> 由于海洋覆盖了地球的大部分表面，因此完全有理由将海床视为地壳的基本形式，陆地、岛屿和海洋的其他特征附加其上。

The continents form rugged tablelands which stand nearly three miles above the floor of the open ocean. ->> 大陆形成了崎岖的高地，几乎高出辽阔海洋的海底三英里。

From the shore line, out a distance which may be anywhere from a few miles to a few hundred miles, runs the gentle slope of the continental shelf, geologically part of the continents. ->> 从海岸线向外延伸数英里到数百英里，是大陆架的缓坡，从地质学上来说是大陆的一部分。

The real dividing line between continents and oceans occurs at the foot of a steeper slope. ->> 大陆和海洋之间真正的分界线在更陡的坡脚处。

This continental slope usually starts at a place somewhere near the 100-fathom mark and in the course of a few hundred miles reaches the true ocean floor at 2,500-3,500 fathoms. ->> 这个大陆坡通常从大约100英寻深度的地方开始，并在几百英里的过程中到达2,500至3,500英寻的真正海底。

The slope averages about 1 in 30, but contains steep, probably vertical, cliffs, and gentle sediment-covered terraces, and near its lower reaches there is a long tailing-off which is almost certainly the result of material transported out to deep water after being eroded from the continental masses. ->> 坡度平均约为1/30，包括陡峭的、甚至是垂直的峭壁，以及沉积物覆盖的平缓阶地，在其下游附近，有很长一段逐渐消失地带，这几乎可以肯定是大陆块体被侵蚀后，物质被水冲到深水处形成的。
