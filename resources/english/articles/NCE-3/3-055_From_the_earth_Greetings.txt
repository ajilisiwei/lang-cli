Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies. ->> 天文学方面的最新发展使得我们能够在银河系和其他星系中发现行星。
This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and do not emit light. ->> 这是一个重要的成就，因为相对来说，行星很小，而且不发光。
Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. ->> 寻找行星已被证明相当困难，而在这些行星上发现生命则会无比艰难。
The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. ->> 第一个需要回答的问题是行星是否能够支持生命。
In our own solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. ->> 举例来说，在我们的太阳系中，金星的温度太高，而火星的温度太低，不适合生命存在。
Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve. ->> 只有地球提供了理想的条件，而且即便如此，植物和动物的演化也花费了超过40亿年的时间。
Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. ->> 一颗行星是否能够维持生命取决于它的恒星，即它的“太阳”的大小和亮度。
Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter, and hotter than our own sun. ->> 设想一个恒星比我们的太阳大、亮和热20倍，那么行星就必须离它的恒星非常远才能支持生命。
A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. ->> 一颗行星必须离恒星非常远才能支持生命。
Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. ->> 反之，如果恒星很小，支持生命的行星需要在靠近恒星的轨道上运转，并且还要具备生命形式发展的理想条件。
But how would we find such a planet? ->> 我们该如何找到这样一颗行星呢？
At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. ->> 目前，还没有一个现存的望远镜能够检测到生命的存在。
The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century. ->> 研制这样一个望远镜将是21世纪天文学的一个重大项目。
It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. ->> 使用基于地球的望远镜来寻找其他行星上的生命是不可能的。
Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. ->> 地球自身温暖的大气层和望远镜产生的热量使得我们无法探测到如行星般小的物体。
Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system. ->> 即使是在地球轨道上运行的望远镜，比如非常成功的哈勃望远镜，由于太阳系中的尘埃粒子也不合适。
A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. ->> 望远镜需要放置在像木星这样遥远的行星上，才能在外层空间寻找生命，因为距离太阳系边缘越远，尘埃就越稀薄。
Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. ->> 一旦我们探测到一颗行星，我们必须找到一种方法遮住它恒星的光芒，这样我们才能清楚地“看到”这颗行星并分析其大气层。
In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'. ->> 首先，我们要寻找的是植物生命，而不是“小绿人”。
The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. ->> 在行星上最有可能发展的生命形式是细菌。
It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. ->> 正是细菌产生了我们在地球上呼吸的氧气。
For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. ->> 在地球历史的大部分时间里，细菌是地球上唯一的生命形式。
As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. ->> 作为地球上的居民，我们总是怀有希望，希望有一天“小绿人”会拜访我们，我们可以与他们交流。
But this hope is always in the realms of science fiction. ->> 但这种希望始终存在于科幻小说的领域中。
If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. ->> 如果我们能够在其他行星上发现像细菌这样的低等生命，这将彻底改变我们对自己的看法。
As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it.' ->> 正如美国国家航空和宇宙航空局的丹尼尔·戈尔丁所观察到的那样：“在其他地方发现生命将改变一切。没有任何人类的努力或想法会不受其影响”。
